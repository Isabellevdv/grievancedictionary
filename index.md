## The Grievance Dictionary

The Grievance Dictionary is a psycholinguistic dictionary which can be used to automatically understand language use in the context of grievance-fuelled violence threat assessment. The development of the dictionary was informed by suggestions from experienced threat assessment practitioners. These suggestions and subsequent human and computational word list generation resulted in a dictionary of 20,502 words annotated by 2,318 participants. The dictionary was validated by applying it to texts written by violent and non-violent individuals, showing strong evidence for linguistic differences between populations and high classification performance.
